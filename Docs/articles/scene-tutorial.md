# CustomScene
A CustomScene is Slugbase's method of allowing an easy way for mod creators to add slugcat-specific scenes, such as unique select screens, sleep screens, or even intro sequences.

CustomScenes are stored either in the `slugbase/scenes/` folder, or inside of (insert link)[CustomSlideshow]s.
